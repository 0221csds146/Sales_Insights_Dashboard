# Data Analysis using MySQL :
Completed the Data discovery and then used mySQL for data analysis.
The import of data is done from an already existing MySQL file. This file has to be loaded into MySQL workbench for further data analysis.
Analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values

We can see that garbage value that the table market cantains certain values which are incorrect.

SELECT * FROM sales.market;

And then we can check that transacation table we can see that ceratin negative value in amount which is not possible. and we can see that certain transactions are in USD. Hence, filtration of that is also needed by converting into INR.

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions;

Similarly, if we want different of any other particular city the market code of that city is used on the mysql workbench.

# Data Analysis (DAX):
Measures used in all visualization are:

Key Measures:

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],[Revenue],0)
Profit Margin Contribution % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])
Revenue Contribution % = DIVIDE([Revenue],CALCULATE([Revenue],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
Revenue LY = CALCULATE([Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date]))
sales quntity = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
Total Profit Margin = SUM('Sales transactions'[Profit_Margin])
Profit Target:

Profit Target1 = GENERATESERIES(-0.05, 0.15, 0.01)
Profit Target Value = SELECTEDVALUE('Profit Target1'[Profit Target])
Target Diff = [Profit Margin %]-'Profit Target1'[Profit Target Value]
